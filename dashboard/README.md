# Hydrophone Front-End App P.O.C

This is a work in progress. As of Feb 2023 this constitutes a functional prototype of the final dashboard product. It uses sample data which is included. The final structure of the data is subject to change, and attention will be given to UX later in the project.

This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for building and local development.

To build and preview the front-end application:

0. (pre-requisite) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system
1. `cd` to the dashboard directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Choose:
    *  **To run a local development server which allows you to interact with the app and see code changes reflected in real time:**
        1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
    *  **To build the application and then preview it:**
        1. Run `npm run build`
        2. Run `npm run preview`.
4. Open the URL provided in the terminal output.
5. (When finished) Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the local server.
